# Is it bird?

## What it is
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented from scratch to determine if given image is a bird or not
* Built for learning purposes

## What is implemented?
* Convolutional Layer
* Dense Layer
* Linear/Logistic regression
* Relu
* Max pooling
* Loss - Binary Cross Entropy
* Backpropagation for all layers
* Data pipeline
* Data normalization

## TBD
* train loop - batch processing
* metric
* Optimization - Vectorization, ADAM

## Lesson Learned
* All things in "What is implmeneted?"
* lot of math ;<
* Performance/Overfitting
  * batch processing, data normalization, vectorization, data augmentation, data distribution (trainset 7 : cross validation set 1.5 : test set 1.5), and many others.. (finding balance to find most generalized model)
* Don't do it from scratch - use Tensorflow/Pytorch ðŸ˜¢


## Used Technology
* Python
* Numpy
* OpenCV - for image translation and data augmentation
